The main aim of this project is to manage the database of an educational institute that provides courses in various domains. It consists of associate details like how many associates were attended for a demo, joined, enrolled for the courses like Bigdata, IoT, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. Whenever the administrator needs information about the associates, they should be able to fetch the required data.
